# KADA0110_EXT
Kada0110_ext is an extended 65% mechanical keyboard. It started as a remix of [Kada 0110](https://www.printables.com/model/891673-kada-0110-a-retro-inspired-65-mechanical-keyboard) by [Emil](https://www.printables.com/@Emil_28197). It has support for stepped left control and split backspace. PCB was designed by me. Case modifications also done by me.
